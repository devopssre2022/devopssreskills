Downloading and installing Jenkins
STEPS:
1) Ensure that your software packages are up to date on your instance by uing the following command to perform a quick software update:

        $ sudo yum update -y

2) Add the Jenkins repo using the following command:

        $ sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo \
            https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo

3) Import a key file from Jenkins-CI to enable installation from the package:

        $ sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io.key
        $ sudo yum upgrade

4) Install Java: as jenkins is built on java - we need to install openjdk11

        $ sudo amazon-linux-extras install java-openjdk11 -y

5) Install Jenkins:

        $ sudo yum install jenkins -y

6) Enable Jenkins service to start at boot:

        $ sudo systemctl enable jenkins

7) Start Jenkins as a service:

        $ sudo systemctl start jenkins
You can check the status of the Jenkins service using the command:

        $ sudo systemctl status jenkins
